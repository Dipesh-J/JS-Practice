/*
* Two Pointers

* In this method we use two pointers to traverse the data structure in a synchronized manner. Generally in 3 ways:

* 1. Opposite Ends
* 2. Same Direction
* 3. Fixed and moving

? When do we use two pointers?
* 1. Problems involving sorted array or strings.
* 2. Finding pairs or triplets that satisfy some condition.
* 3. Solving problems with subarray sums or subsequences.
* 4. Searching for elements in a specific intervals.

TODO: On Leetcode
* 1. Two Sum
* 2. Remove Duplicates from a sorted array
* 3. Checking for Palindrome
* 4. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
